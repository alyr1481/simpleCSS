# simpleCSS - A Lightweight Utility Based CSS Stylesheet

This is very much a work in progress, these are the things im wanting to achieve:
* A Bootstrap Like Grid System but better and based on cssgrid
* An easier to understand for newbies implementation of flexbox
* Decent and concise documentation.

This is a side project and definatley not to be used in production. Contributions are always welcomed
